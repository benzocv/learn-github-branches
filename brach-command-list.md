#Create a branch

To create a new branch, you can use the "git branch" command followed by the name of your new branch. For example, if you want to create a new branch called "my-new-feature", you would run the following command:

`git branch my-new-feature`


#Switch to a branch

To switch to a different branch, you can use the "git checkout" command followed by the name of the branch. For example, if you want to switch to the "my-new-feature" branch, you would run the following command:

`git checkout my-new-feature`


#Make changes

Once you're on your new branch, you can make changes to the codebase as you see fit. You can add, delete, or modify files, and make any other changes you need to.


#Commit changes

After making changes, you need to commit them to your branch. You can use the "git add" and "git commit" commands to stage and commit your changes, respectively. For example


`git add .`
`git commit -m "Added new feature"`

#Push changes

Finally, you can push your changes to the remote repository using the "git push" command. This will make your changes available to others who have access to the repository. For example

`git push origin my-new-feature`


#Merge branches


When you're done working on your branch and want to merge it back into the main codebase, you can create a pull request. A pull request is a request to merge your changes from your branch into the main codebase. Other developers can review your changes and provide feedback before the changes are merged. To create a pull request, go to the repository on GitHub and click on the "New pull request" button. From there, select your branch and the branch you want to merge into, and click "Create pull request".
